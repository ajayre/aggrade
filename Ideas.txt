1. Close button that closes the app and shuts down the tablet

2. Key press that closes app

3. Show keyboard button - osk.exe?

4. Show status button: shows GPS/RTK/IMU values for all three items of equipment.

5. Survey button: shows settings panel, enter field name, start, then shows map, with button to end boundary and end survey. Allow benchmarks to be recorded

6. Grading button - choose field

7. Calibration button - set blade zero heights, set GNSS antenna location from driving?

8. Settings screen:
  - COM ports
  - difference between true and magnetic north
  - enable data logging (on by default)

9. When cutting show yellow strip on map indicating cutting length and width. Support turns during cutting

10. Map view options:

  - toggle cuts and fills on and off
  - existing topo and cut/fill map
  - original topo and cut/fill map
  - cut/fill map shows work that has been completed
  - toggle tractor path trail on/off
  - toggle turn guidance from current point on/off
  - toggle edge buffer/clearance on/off
  - toggle flashing/indication of highest areas and lowest areas on/off
  - north up, tractor up
  - toggle guidance line to nearest lowest area
  - toggle tractor in center or bottom center
  - areas where the topo won't change much (locations for top soil)

11. Turn guidance - at current point for tractor show how a turn could be completed to double-back on a parallel path, e.g. omega. Continually update this until edge of field reached at which point it turns red for last chance turn, then turns into a turn to travel down edge of field

12. Equipment settings:
  - tractor/pan widths
  - turning circle
  - enable/disable pans - disable when doing survey work without them - changes map edge buffer/clearance if a pan is wider than the tractor
  - float blade on surface when disabling cutting mode (per pan setting)
  - raise blade to x cm above surface when disabling cutting mode (per pan setting)

13. Map edge buffer/clearance - using equipment width show closest centerline to edges of field

14. Blades profile/cross section screen
  - show current height
  - show final height
  - show max blade cut depth
  - show current blade depth

15. Status info:
  - RTK status
  - speed
  - heading
  - IMU quality
  - status bar has LEDs: OOO RTK OOO IMU OO HEIGHT - LEDs flash red when data not available and solid green when available. Greyed out if front or rear scraper is disabled (e.g. survey mode)
  - beep if green LED turns red

16. Data logging - create csv file with date/time stamp as filename. Record speed, direction, location, blade status, blade height

17. Simulator - use named pipes so sim runs as a separate process

18. Blades have three states:
  - cutting (active control)
    - enabled by pressing work switch
  - floating (active control)
    - enabled by exiting cutting mode if configured in settings
  - manual
    - enabled by moving joystick or exiting cutting mode if float not enabled
