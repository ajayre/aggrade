2. Key press that closes app

3. Show keyboard button - osk.exe?

4. Show status button: shows GPS/RTK/IMU values for all three items of equipment.

5. Survey button: shows settings panel, enter field name, start, then shows map, with button to end boundary and end survey. Allow benchmarks to be recorded

6. Grading button - choose field

7. Calibration button - set blade zero heights, set GNSS antenna location from driving?

8. Settings screen:
  - enable data logging (on by default)

9. When cutting show yellow strip on map indicating cutting length and width. Support turns during cutting

10. Map view options:

  - toggle cuts and fills on and off
  - existing topo and cut/fill map
  - original topo and cut/fill map
  - cut/fill map shows work that has been completed
  - toggle tractor path trail on/off
  - toggle turn guidance from current point on/off
  - toggle edge buffer/clearance on/off
  - toggle flashing/indication of highest areas and lowest areas on/off
  - north up, tractor up
  - toggle guidance line to nearest lowest area
  - toggle tractor in center or bottom center
  - areas where the topo won't change much (locations for top soil)
  - markers at start and end of last cut and last fill
  - stripping map - red = bin at original height, orange = bin between original and target height, green = bin at target height

11. Turn guidance - at current point for tractor show how a turn could be completed to double-back on a parallel path, e.g. omega. Continually update this until edge of field reached at which point it turns red for last chance turn, then turns into a turn to travel down edge of field

12. Equipment settings:
  - tractor/pan widths
  - turning circle
  - enable/disable pans - disable when doing survey work without them - changes map edge buffer/clearance if a pan is wider than the tractor
  - float blade on surface when disabling cutting mode (per pan setting)
  - raise blade to x cm above surface when disabling cutting mode (per pan setting)
  - scraper capacities in LCY

13. Map edge buffer/clearance - using equipment width show closest centerline to edges of field

14. Blades profile/cross section screen
  - show current height
  - show final height
  - show max blade cut depth
  - show current blade depth

15. Status info:
  - RTK status
  - speed
  - heading
  - IMU quality
  - status bar has LEDs: OOO RTK OOO IMU OO HEIGHT - LEDs flash red when data not available and solid green when available. Greyed out if front or rear scraper is disabled (e.g. survey mode)
  - beep if green LED turns red

16. Data logging - use SQLite database. Record speed, direction, location, blade status, blade height

18. Blades have three states:
  - cutting (active control)
    - enabled by pressing work switch
  - floating (active control)
    - enabled by exiting cutting mode if configured in settings
  - manual
    - enabled by moving joystick or exiting cutting mode if float not enabled


21. Transparency option for tractor display

22. Map scale.

23. OSM and satellite images around field.

24. Manual slope entry and calculate for cut/fill ratio and import/export

25. Don't allow dead reckoning to run for more than two seconds

27. Log total amount of cut and fill for field (save between runs) and show percentage complete for field
  - keep track of time operating?
  - give prediction on remaining hours?
  - show on secondary tablet?

28. Calibrate field height
  - drive to benchmark, capture GPS height, correct survey data to match new benchmark height

30. Map showing all cuts and fills (colored according to passes?)

31. SQLite database for all field data
 - table with current field state (bin heights)
 - table with history of bin height changes
   - timestamp
   - bin id
   - height change
 - table with event history
   - positions
   - headings
   - speed
   - blade height
   - blade state - cutting/filling/etc
   - one entry per change with timestamp
   - columns
     - timestamp
	 - action (tractorpos, speed, frontbladeheight, etc)
	 - data (lat/lon, heightmm, etc)
 - table with x/y/z calibration data

32. Save map display settings between starts
